    This is a project I've been working on for about a month now.  I thought of it after learning about OOP from
    rmotr.com's Intro to Python class (which I highly recommend). The project started out fine but quickly
    got overwhelming for this beginner.
    I think the problem was I got carried away with the many classes and objects.  It turned into a giant knot
    of classes referencing other classes and methods and imports and it got out of hand.
    Today I sat down and (physically) wrote out how a turn should play and what needed to be done in each step.
    I commented out the previous code and entered all the steps for what I need to work on next.

    There is still one problem I haven't figured out how to handle.  In the actual game of Yam Slam, there are no
    tokens for a YamSlam (getting all the same number on the dice).  If you get a Yam Slam, you are to just take the
    tile left with the most points.  Currently in the code, it checks to see if there are any tokens for a particular
    combo.  In the case of a Yam Slam, it would throw an error because I never made any tokens for a Yam Slam.  So, as
    a minor fix, I had to add 100 tokens for Yam Slam.  But I do have to figure out how to work around it.  I may
    have it check to see if the dice == a combo before it checks to see if there are any tokens.  I don't know yet.

    Goals for tomorrow:  Write the functions for a turn.  I had already done most of the work so I don't think it will
    be too difficult.

    I got the main gameplay 'working'.  There are some bugs.
        1. It doesn't switch players
        2. It takes out two tokens for a winning hand instead of one
        3. At least one hand that should have been a Large Straight was scored as a Small Straight.
        4. I got an error on what should have been a Flush.

    I suppose this means I have to start unittesting.  :( Boo.  Unittesting is large and scary to me.
    But I know it's a skill I need.  If anything, it will help me understand what I need to return.
    I think that's the problem with the score_the_roll().  I'm not sure if I'm putting through the proper parameters
    and I don't have a way of testing it yet.  Playing with the random numbers that I pass through will not get me there.
    I'm pretty sure there's something wrong with the third roll and what it's returning.

    Goals for tomorrow: Figure out what is happening with the third roll.  Figure out how to switch players.
    Start writing at least one test every day.  After pushing this, I will find a good tutorial.
